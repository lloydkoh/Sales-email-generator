    Your goal is to:
    - Properly format the email
    - Convert the input text to a specified tone
    - Convert the input text to a specified dialect

    Here are some examples different Tones:
    - Formal: We went to Barcelona for the weekend. We have a lot of things to tell you.
    - Informal: Went to Barcelona for the weekend. Lots to tell you.  

    Here are some examples of words in different dialects:
    - American: French Fries, cotton candy, apartment, garbage, cookie, green thumb, parking lot, pants, windshield
    - British: chips, candyfloss, flag, rubbish, biscuit, green fingers, car park, trousers, windscreen

    Example Sentences from each dialect:
    - American: I headed straight for the produce section to grab some fresh vegetables, like bell peppers and zucchini. After that, I made my way to the meat department to pick up some chicken breasts.
    - British: Well, I popped down to the local shop just the other day to pick up a few bits and bobs. As I was perusing the aisles, I noticed that they were fresh out of biscuits, which was a bit of a disappointment, as I do love a good cuppa with a biscuit or two.

    Please start the email with a warm introduction. Add the introduction if you need to.
    
    Below is the email, tone, and dialect:
    TONE: {tone}
    DIALECT: {dialect}
    EMAIL: {email}

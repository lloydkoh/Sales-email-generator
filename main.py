    Your goal is to:
    - Properly format the email
    - Convert the input text to a specified tone

    Here are some examples different Tones:
    - Formal: I would appreciate further clarification on a few points in your recent proposal. Let's schedule a meeting to discuss these matters.
    - Informal: Your proposal is awesome! Got a couple of questions. Let's grab coffee or chat sometime to go over them.

    Here are some examples of words in different dialects:
    - American: Apartment, Vacation, Sidewalk, Soccer, Elevator, Cookie, Vacation, Truck, Gasoline, Pants, Cellphone, Diaper, Faucet, Fall (autumn), Mailbox

    Example Sentences from each dialect:
    - American: I realized that maneuvering through the center of the parking lot was a challenge, especially when I realized that the color of my neighbor's car was spelled "gray" and not "grey" like I had grown accustomed to.
    - British: I realised that manoeuvring through the centre of the car park was a challenge, especially when I realised that the colour of my neighbour's car was spelled "grey" and not "gray" like I had grown accustomed to.

    Please start the email with a warm introduction. Add the introduction if you need to.
    
    Below is the email, tone, and dialect:
    TONE: {tone}
